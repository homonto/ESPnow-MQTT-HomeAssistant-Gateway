ESPnow testing battery:


//S board, 180s sleep, max gauge, sht, tsl - 090
- work: 570ms, 50mA
- sleep:  7.5uA
peaks to 80uA for 1.8s
30 minutes average: 200uA (wifi disable, isolate gpios, room logging disabled)
-> 4 000 hours S2 with average 80uA = 166 days, 5.5 months


//S2 board, 180s sleep, max gauge, sht, tsl - 091
- work: 220ms, 38mA
- sleep:  25uA
peaks to 130uA for 2s
30 minutes average: 76-80uA (wifi disable, isolate gpios, room logging disabled)
-> 10 000 hours S2 with average 80uA = 417 days, 13.7 months

//S2 board, 180s sleep, max gauge, sht, tept - 100
- work: 185ms, 38mA
- sleep:  25uA
peaks to 200uA for 2s
30 minutes average: 70uA (wifi disable, isolate gpios, room logging disabled)
-> 11 429 hours S2 with average 70uA = 476 days, 15.8 months

conclusion: S2 much better due to much shorter work time

peaks could be:
- sensors
- unicast
check all
